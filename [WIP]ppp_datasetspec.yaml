  - A dataset specification consists of 4 fields, which fully describe the dataset in the scene-level and the part-level abstractions, and in semantic and instance information layers.
  - The specification refers to the dataset structure itself and does not induce any evaluation specification.
  - The fields `scene_class2part_classes` and `scene_classes_with_instance` are required. The fields `scene_class2color` and `countable_parts_grouping` are optional. The full description of the fields is given in DatasetSpec class and a short description is provided below.


# scene_class2part_classes: An ordered mapping from scene-level class to part-level classes.
# The mapping defines implicitly (by the order of elements) their 1-based ids, e.g.
# "aeroplane": sid = 1, "aeroplane body": pid = 1. The 0 id is reserved for the "unlabeled" class,
# which represents unlabeled/void/background/do-not-care pixels, and is omitted for both scene-level
# and part-level classes, i.e. "unlabeled": sid = 0, "aeroplane unlabeled": pid = 0. The scene-level
# sids induced by the ordering correspond as-is to the sids in the annotations (ground truth
# image-like files). The part-level pids induced by the ordering correspond to the pids in the
# annotations after being folded using the countable_parts_grouping mapping.

# PPP contains instance-wise information for the part-level abstraction for a selection of classes.
# This is implemented with different part ids for each part-level semantic class per image,
# e.g. "aeroplace engine" has 10 pids meaning that an image can have up to 10 different unique engine,
# which can belong to multiple aeroplanes. Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation does not require this
# information level, thus the following mappings from the part-level semantic class to the
# instance-wise pids can be used to remove the instance information layer from the part-level
# abstraction. The function ... can be used.
