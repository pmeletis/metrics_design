  - This file contains the new format for the definitions of the tasks ppp_100_71 and ppp_20_58.
  - countable_parts_grouping provides a mapping of the union of the countable parts to the respective pids.
  - general_dict contains the complete information of the semantic classes with and without part-level annotations. Both sid and pid are ordered and start from 1. Unlabeled class is not included. The countable_parts are folded as one part class.
  - part_groupings provides the information of the grouped part-level classes. The countable parts are again folded. Background, ignored and void classes are not included.

# General preprocessing step (these countable parts occupy a list of pids)
